            <p id="tribute-info">Robin Williams was a comedian and actor who had roles in a great deal of childrens films in the early 90s, and as such became a familiar face to
                many millenials. His roles ranged from silly, exuberent professor in Flubber..to the a that of a mentor in Good Will Hunting and Dead Poet's Society. In movies like
                Bird Cage and Mrs. Doubtfire he remained brilliantly funny while still showing a great deal of emotional depth in very serious situations that affected many growing up
                during the time period ranging from issues with sexuality (Bird Cage) to those of estrangement from parents (Mrs. Doubtfire).
